## We created a network system architecture to provide simple access and sophisticated tools to researchers and members of the public interested in Australia’s rich cultural heritage

### The information challenge
Deakin University wanted to consolidate 30 of Australia’s most significant cultural and creative arts datasets into a National Virtual Laboratory as part of the Australian government’s NeCTAR (National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Resources) program.

Each dataset is uniquely designed and curated, with different structures, information, and access priorities separating their 2 million+ collection of records.

Despite the value that these resources offer, awareness and accessibility was limited. A new information management system was needed to enable easier navigation of the vast collections.

### Our digital solution
Following a process of consultation and planning with the Deakin team, Logicly designed and developed the HuNI Virtual Lab, a research and discovery platform for humanities and creative arts scholars, as well as for the wider public.

The Lab was a simple data solution designed to provide researchers who register with simple tools to support the sophisticated, nonlinear methods often practiced in the humanities.

To further encourage engagement with the wider Australian community, the Lab also provides easy access for more casual browsing to curious members of the public.

### The outcomes
HuNI allows researchers to engage more effectively with the aggregated collections, providing streamlined, user-friendly tools to access and analyse resources, and to share their work.

In particular, it can provide insights that more limiting, traditional keyword searches don’t by generating visual graphs showing dynamic networks of connections between datasets and records.
