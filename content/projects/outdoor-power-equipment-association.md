## We created a secure data management system for processing and delivering key insights to participating members

### The information challenge
The Outdoor Power Equipment Association collects and analyses industry sales data from member businesses to provide them with important insights into how their sector is performing.

Gathering high volumes of information in complicated spreadsheets for manual analysis and reporting was a drain on resources and could result in errors.

A more consistent, automated data solution that could guarantee greater accuracy was needed.

### Our digital solution
We developed a data collection application that could track sales and allow members to upload the figures securely and anonymously in the correct format.

It streamlines and consolidates the raw information, extracts important findings, and returns individualised reports to each member.

The approach also made it possible to review and clean the older datasets in order to recapture their value and strengthen future observations.

### The outcomes
Since implementation, the data has been more complete and consistent, and the insights have become more accurate.

Logicly’s helpdesk team offer support for users directly, as well as refining the data analysis process along the way.

OPEA staff are no longer stuck processing raw information month after month; instead they’re freed up to take on bigger, less repetitive tasks.
