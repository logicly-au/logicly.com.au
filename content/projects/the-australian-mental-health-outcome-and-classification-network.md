## We helped create the AMHOCN in 2003 for the Department of Health, and continue to shape and maintain it to provide an essential tool for improving mental health in Australia.

### The information challenge
The AMHOCN exists to provide nation-wide leadership to the mental health sector. It relies on accurate mental health outcome data from across Australia in order to research, analyse, and deliver important public health service insights and plans.

#### To provide valuable, relevant outcomes that can support improved mental health in Australia, they needed a way to:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>collect raw data efficiently, and</li>
    <li>return accessible information on mental health outcomes in the public system to clinicians
and stakeholders via the National Outcomes Casemix Collection (NOCC)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Our digital solution
Logicly partnered with AMHOCN and the Department of Health (DoH) to plan and implement research projects based on Australia’s mental health outcome data.

Feedback from these was provided to end users, hospitals, networks and jurisdictions based on the findings.

#### Three organisations helped to deliver the solution, each contributing a key element:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>A bureau for data collection and processing - Logicly</li>
    <li>A clear analysis and reporting component - The University of Queensland</li>
    <li>Training and support for clinics to ensure ongoing management and development -
The Health Education and Training Institute</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Since its establishment in 2003, the system architecture continues to provide high-quality data analysis and information management with Logicly’s ongoing support and maintenance, including:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>The Web Accessible Data Cube (containing aggregated data for the tools and portals)</li>
    <li>Maintenance of the secure, catalogued NOCC data warehouse</li>
    <li>The Reports Portal (for accessing complex and sophisticated analysis of NOCC data)</li>
    <li>The Web Decision Support Tool (used for patient information storage and comparison
with similar NOCC cases)</li>
    <li>The online K-10 tool (for consumer mental health self-assessment)</li>
    <li>Data submission and validation processes for the States and Territories</li>
    <li>Technical specifications and expertise for data source contributors</li>
    <li>Infrastructure and technical support for the website</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### The outcomes

AMHOCN is more than a data management application.

It’s a robust, strategically-designed system that for over 15 years has continually evolved and adapted successfully in response to shifts in government policy and department needs.

It will continue to help shape better mental health outcomes for Australia into the future by consistently delivering clear, accurate insights from raw, complex, data.
