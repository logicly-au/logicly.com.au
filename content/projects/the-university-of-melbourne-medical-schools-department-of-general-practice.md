## We designed and implemented a rigorous nation-wide trial of a new digital health tool prototype.

### The information challenge
The University of Melbourne wanted to trial a new approach to stepped health care in general practice, particularly focused on delivering care to those with complex mental health needs.

The research team designed a rigorous large-scale randomised controlled trial to test whether a purpose-built Decision Support Tool (DST) could offer clinical and cost effective benefits to identifying and providing tailored treatment recommendations to those with low and high levels of mental health needs. 

Ensuring that the tool reliably delivered appropriate mental health analyses required an ethics-focussed approach, as well as complex data structures and workflows that would accurately reflect best practice in research.

The context of the challenge also made it essential that the information system was extremely secure.

### Logicly's digital solution
Logicly was engaged to develop and implement a Decision Support Tool (DST) which evaluated the participant’s mental health through an online survey using a tablet device, while they sat in a GP waiting room.

Logicly and study psychologists collaborated closely to develop the tool, and worked with the Department of Health and Aged Care’s IT security team to ensure the application met the high level security requirements appropriate for the project.

The DST implemented complex algorithms based on participant responses to identify the level of support participants should receive, and filtered participants into random ‘control’ and 'intervention' groups. The application sent corresponding alternative surveys to each set over 18 months at predefined milestones. These surveys sought to assess the effectiveness of the targeted support they were offered.

A secure administrative tool supported Care Navigators in providing one-on-one help to the intervention participants. This application enabled Care Navigators to provide urgent support where it was needed, record and evaluate notes and outcomes, as well as managing appointments and follow-ups. 

It also gave the principal researchers access to manage the information system, monitor progress, and track insights. Access to aggregated data provided the researchers with the ability to respond quickly to requests for information from project sponsors and other stakeholders.

### The outcomes
The collaborative approach ensured the value of the information, the highest level of ethical integrity, and compliance with the Australian Government’s Protective Security Policy Framework.

The project successfully generated valuable insights, with more than 13,000 respondents across multiple states participating in the DST trial, providing the University’s researchers with large quantities of high quality data and insights.

This trial laid the foundation for ongoing advancements in offering both clinically effective and cost-effective mental health support.
