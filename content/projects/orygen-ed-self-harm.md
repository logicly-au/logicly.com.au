### Snapshot
Orygen, a youth mental health organisation, and the Centre for Mental Health at the University of Melbourne partnered with Victorian emergency departments to develop a research database to support research into suicide prevention. Orygen needed to consolidate data from multiple hospital sites, but faced challenges due to fragmented data, inconsistent historical records, and privacy concerns. 

Logicly collaborated with Orygen to develop a database schema, map the historical data to new data elements, and create a secure, scalable tool for ongoing data supply. The project resulted in an accurate database, a streamlined data submission process, and tools for data curation—empowering Orygen to gain valuable insights for suicide prevention research and policy development.

### The problem
Orygen identified the need for a robust, Victoria-based, self-harm research database to:

    <ul>
        <li>track the prevalence of self-harm presentations to emergency departments,</li>
        <li>analyse demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics, and</li>
        <li>inform the development and evaluation of clinical and policy initiatives.</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
</div>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">“Around one quarter of deaths by people between the ages of 15 and 25 are attributed to suicide. In addition to evaluating interventions specifically designed for at-risk young people, Orygen also has a strong focus on informing and evaluating national, and state-based, suicide prevention policy.”</h2>

Orygen partnered with multiple emergency departments across Victoria to consolidate self-harm data from 2012 onward and ensure the ongoing supply of new data for trend analysis, risk factor identification, and intervention development.

### Data challenges

The historical data provided by the emergency departments was fragmented, inconsistent, and hard to interpret in its original form. Consolidating this data and building a system for continuous data supply required a partner with expertise in developing robust and flexible data schemas, and the practical realities of data collection across different sites.

Having worked with Logicly in the past, Orygen knew Logicly had the necessary experience to develop a robust database and data collection application that could handle historical inconsistencies and support ongoing data uploads.

### Unlocking data's potential: effective data mapping and data linkage

Rigorous data mapping, which involves aligning data elements from different systems into a unified format, requires an understanding of how the data elements relate and a broader view of the project’s objectives. 

Each participating hospital site used unique data collection systems that have evolved over time, resulting in nearly 10 different versions of data files since 2012. Logicly reviewed all versions and mapped the data to a single database schema modelled on the <a href="https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/">Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD).</a> This process involved interpreting the data element concepts and automating transformations to ensure consistency across the database for millions of emergency department presentations. The outcome was a reliable historical database capable of generating meaningful insights for research.

### Developing a secure tool for ongoing data supply and curation

For the database to remain valuable over time, an efficient data submission and curation process was essential. To facilitate this, Logicly developed a user-friendly application designed to accept data files in their native formats from various sites. The application automatically validates and transforms data into the research database schema.

Ensuring data privacy was a priority. The system was designed to exclude any identifiable patient information. Data transformations further anonymised records, replacing site-specific IDs with study IDs and birthdates with age data.

The application also features helpful tools like sparklines to visualise data trends, making it easy to spot anomalies such as missing records or spikes in presentations. Researchers can filter data by date, data supplier, visit reason, and outcome, improving the ease of analysis.
