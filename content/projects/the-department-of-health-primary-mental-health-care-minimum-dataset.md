## We developed a secure and complex data management system that works for all stakeholders and their needs

### The information challenge
The DoH and the Primary Health Networks (PHN) wanted to track the quality of current mental healthcare services offered by their providers to improve planning and funding for the future.

To achieve this, they wanted to consolidate different health service datasets in a new, secure, more accessible information system called the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC MDS).

#### Requirements for this included:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Full implementation and delivery in a tight, six-month timeframe - ready for the launch of a new government funding model</li>
    <li>Sophisticated, complex data analysis in clear, succinct reports</li>
    <li>An intuitive and easy-to-use interface to keep workload to a minimum</li>
    <li>Secure data collection in compliance with the Australian Signals Directorate</li>
    <li>Allowing for multiple methods for data provision to work with existing systems</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Our digital solution
Logicly worked closely with stakeholders to design an easy-to-use application, meet critical deadlines, and safeguard the integrity of the data solution.

#### Stage 1 involved completion of:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>An accessible user-management interface</li>
    <li>Bulk data upload capability</li>
    <li>Data mapping to migrate legacy information</li>
    <li>Working with multiple stakeholders to achieve consensus for consistent data content protocols</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Stage 2 involved completion of:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>A user-friendly data entry interface</li>
    <li>A secure and robust data processing pipeline</li>
    <li>A suite of customised reports</li>
    <li>An online version of each outcome measure</li>
    <li>Third-party developer access for integration with existing systems</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### The outcomes
The collaboration between Logicly, DoH and the PHNs has resulted in an application that enables data providers to supply required data in the way that works best for them.

Because of this, the MDS provides access to insights and comprehensive reporting for in-depth analysis to DoH and the PHNs.

It’s a stable and feature-rich platform that evolves and improves as new data sources are added and new reports developed.
  
Logicly provides ongoing support to DoH and PHNs, offering:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>management of data definitions and file specifications</li>
    <li>the PMHC MDS website</li>
    <li>a helpdesk to assist users and support training.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Logicly is a longtime partner of the DoH, having worked with them on numerous projects for more than 15 years.
