## We created a flexible solution to enable health organisations to collect and analyse large quantities of self-reported customer health outcome information.

### The information challenge
The health sector’s capacity to ensure community wellbeing depends on the collection of high-quality, relevant, and secure data.

It’s a complex industry; different organisations have unique information requirements, and collecting high volumes of detailed, accurate data can quickly eat into available resources.

A data solution was needed that could be easily used by staff, and be adapted to the needs of different groups.

### Our digital solution
We collaborated with industry leaders and stakeholders to understand the challenges faced by different health organisations.

The process revealed areas of common opportunity where a solution could be designed and implemented.

A data collection and information management system was needed that would be accessible for users, flexible so that providers could shape it to their needs, and automated to reduce risk of human error.

### The outcomes
The Outcome Measures Self Service System (OMSSS) is a health data collection solution that can be adapted by different health groups to suit their unique preferences.

The ability to automate integration with client systems has the benefit of cutting staff time spent on data-entry, as well as ensuring the accuracy of the information.

It’s accessible and user-friendly, with an intuitive design that is streamlined for both desktop and mobile devices, making it easy for customers to adopt.
