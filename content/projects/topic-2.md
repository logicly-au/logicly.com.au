# Digital transformation in the public sector is accelerating
The global shift to digitisation is transforming the way we live and work and the Australian public sector has a crucial role to play in creating online systems that are simple, quick and safe to use. COVID-19 has led to the rapid explosion in online services, and government agencies are looking to embrace the efficiency and effectiveness gains that deliver better experiences for citizens, staff and businesses. The goal now is to have all government services available online by 2025.

It’s a big shift for some public servants who now find themselves at the centre of this revolution. There’s a need to upskill, collaborate and think differently about processes and information needs. If you’re responsible for delivering a new digital information system in the public sector, here’s some tips for setting your project up for success.

## 7 tips to set your digital project up for success

### 1. Take advantage of the wealth of internal resources
The <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/about-us">Digital Transformation Agency</a> has a fantastic website packed with information to help you deliver great digital services. From updates on the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/digital-transformation-strategy">digital transformation strategy</a>, to <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/building-digital-skills-across-government">what training is available</a> and the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects">tools and platforms that exist</a> – this is an excellent resource to help you get started. It’s also useful to talk to people within government who have delivered similar projects and learn from their experiences – the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/communities-practice">Communities of Practice</a> are a great place to connect.

### 2. Engage with vendors early
If your requirements aren’t well defined but you have a general understanding of the problem you want to solve, talk to potential suppliers in the planning stage, well before you write your tender. You can explore potential solutions, trial ideas and seek feedback. It helps ensure your solution is fully considered before you start the process of engaging a supplier. It also minimises disruptions to timelines and budgets down the track. <a href="https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000575036-Ask-the-market">Ask the market</a> is a government system we recommend that enables you to tap into and leverage innovation and ideas from industry through Expressions of Interest or Requests for Information.

### 3. Understand the rules
Procurement guidelines can be complex but it’s worth investing the time to fully understand them. Talk to your internal procurement team and explore the detailed <a href="https://www.finance.gov.au/government/procurement">online information available</a>. There is also a specific <a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/sp">ICT procurement portal</a> to guide you through the process.

### 4. Find an organisation that has made it easy to work with them
Suppliers must be registered on a panel to work with the government. Use the <a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/sp?id=buyer&kb=KB0010622">Digital Marketplace</a> to find approved suppliers for any digital product or service, including digital transformation projects.

### 5. Choose a partner with proven public sector experience
Working with government is vastly different to working with the private sector. The industry is highly regulated, with roles often more siloed. If you choose a supplier who is new to working with government, you should expect them to be on a steep learning curve as they negotiate unique government protocols. We recommend choosing a supplier who can demonstrate previous successful projects, who has invested in building in-house knowledge of government security, accessibility, and procurement requirements and processes.

### 6. Pare down the project into something that is manageable
Tightly define your project’s goals and objectives into something that is deliverable in a finite amount of time. It’s critical to understand that most digital transformation projects take time, and the best results are achieved when you deliver quickly then engage in frequent incremental releases that account for real life feedback. It’s important to choose a partner who believes in this long-term approach and will support you throughout the life of the project.

### 7. Future proof it
Try not to fall into the trap of merely digitising the way we do things today – that limits the potential benefits, and the system is less likely to be able to adapt to unpredictable change. Instead, look at the process of digitisation as an opportunity to remove unnecessary processes and transform systems so that they are flexible, easy to use and able to adapt to unforeseen future challenges.
