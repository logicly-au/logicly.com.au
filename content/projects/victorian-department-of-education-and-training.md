## We designed and implemented a simple and robust data collection solution for gathering a statewide census

### The information challenge
The Department of Education and Training (DET) needed a sophisticated and accessible data management system for collecting their thrice-yearly Kindergarten census.

A high level of security was required to assure privacy of the personal details and routines of approximately 72,000 children and their teachers.

The data solution would need to deliver accurate results, as well as be developed and implemented within tight timelines

### Our digital solution
We worked closely with the DET team to understand the requirements, and to design the content and flow of the solution.

To effectively capture the right data, multiple surveys were created within the information system, each built with care to safeguard the quality of the results.
  
Because of the tight timelines, we approached the build in stages to have each component of the project ready as it was needed.

### The outcomes

Logicly provided a full service helpdesk throughout the collection period to support kindergartens with submitting accurate and complete datasets.

In spite of the restricted timeframes, the designed solution was successfully implemented across the state.

The DET continued to use the Logicly online survey system routinely to gather insights needed for early-learning strategy and policy.
