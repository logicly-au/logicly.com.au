## A robust online tool to validate and transfer large amounts of government-to-government data safely.

### The information challenge
Each year the Australian States and Territories submit mental health service data to the Department of Health (DoH) based on National Mental Health Strategy guidelines.

The complex process of checking large data sets for inconsistencies and errors was previously done manually, and involved time-consuming work to resolve inconsistencies between jurisdictions.

A more efficient data validation process was needed to save stakeholder time and effort, and guarantee greater accuracy.

### Our digital solution
Logicly designed the Online Validator as an early innovation in one of the first DoH projects, building a tool for automating the validation process and safeguarding accurate data collection.

It checks that the file structure is correct, then reports any data inconsistencies, and can be flexibly adapted to deliver new or different outcomes as needed.

#### Other functions include:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Capture of metadata and social data, preserving a historical record of the dialogue between submitters and reviewers</li>
    <li>Providing various levels access for data submission and review</li>
    <li>Historical trend insights</li>
    <li>Provision of comparative analysis</li>
    <li>Identification of recurring errors</li>
  </ul>
</div>


### The outcomes
The Online Validator reduced the time and costs required to manually verify data submitted for annual reporting and evaluation, and has further resulted in reports that are more timely, accurate, and effective for decision making.

It is extremely secure, with a system classified as ‘Protected’ by the Australian Government Protective Security Policy Framework standards.
  
The interface presents the complex workflow in a simple, intuitive way to assist occasional users to efficiently submit and review their data.

It is also compliant with WCAG 2.0 guidelines at the AA level, meeting the Government’s obligations under the Australian Government’s Information Management Office’s Website Accessibility National Transition Strategy (NTS).
