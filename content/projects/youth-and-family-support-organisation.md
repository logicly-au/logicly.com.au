## We created a data analysis solution that could be adapted to better capture new insights with clarity as they emerged.

### The information challenge
An initial program pilot designed to support vulnerable families and youth in the community accumulated vast amounts of raw, complex information.

#### Mining this material for valuable insights to understand the program’s efficacy would require:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Consolidation of multiple datasets</li>
    <li>Secure information management</li>
    <li>Sophisticated data processing and analysis</li>
    <li>Concise findings</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Our digital solution
We worked closely with the client to understand the challenge and its constraints, and to explore viable options.

The volume of data and the complicated nature of the problem meant it was unclear exactly what insights would eventually be needed. The data solution therefore had to enable sophisticated analysis, as well as be dynamic and flexible.

### The outcomes
Once the solution was implemented and analysis began, a clearer picture of the program’s impact emerged. These findings challenged underlying assumptions that had informed the program’s initial development.

Logicly’s adaptive design meant it was possible to respond to the new insights and changed circumstances. It could be adjusted as needed to further enrich the value of the information, even as it was gathered.
