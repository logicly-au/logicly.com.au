### The information challenge
The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) uses large quantities of survey data to understand future growth and demand, and to inform infrastructure and public transport projects.

They needed a new, paper-free data collection approach that could deliver greater efficiency, accuracy, and a user-friendly experience to improve participation rates.

#### The requirements for this included:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>An interface for team leaders managing admin in the field</li>
    <li>A fieldworkers’ interface for tracking progress and assisting participants</li>
    <li>A user-friendly online survey portal</li>
    <li>Secure data collection</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Our digital solution
Logicly consulted with subject-matter experts and facilitated stakeholder workshops to understand the context of the challenge and in particular, user behaviour.

Through a highly collaborative and iterative approach, we drew on extensive experience with complex information systems to develop, test, and refine the data solution.

The components were delivered in phases:

<span style="font-weight:800">Phase 1</span>

Design, user testing and delivery of an HTML prototype of the online survey

<span style="font-weight:800">Phase 2</span>

Delivery of the TMR Tertiary Student Travel Survey (2016) across three University campuses

<span style="font-weight:800">Phase 3</span>

Modification of the Tertiary Student Travel Survey to form the user interface for household data collection (SEQTS)

<span style="font-weight:800">Phase 4</span>

Design, user testing and delivery of the administration interface


### The outcomes
The outcomes exceeded client expectations and the Household Travel Survey is now managed almost entirely online, with the user experience continually evolving and improving.

Accuracy and efficiency has increased with the intuitive data collection application and accessible mobile- and desktop-friendly interfaces.

In addition, completion and participation rates have each improved significantly since the survey’s implementation online.
