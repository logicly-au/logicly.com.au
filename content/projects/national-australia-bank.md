## We created a data collection tool to cut through the complexity of seeking the insights needed to achieve better performances across a vast workforce

### The information challenge
The National Australian Bank needed a way to create and deliver personalised performance management surveys to its 40,000+ strong workforce.

They wanted to analyse the high volumes of data efficiently and communicate the results in accessible reports.

It was essential due to the nature of their industry that the solution could comply with rigorous security requirements.

### Our digital solution
Developing a data management system that could set NAB up for success required a process of thorough consultation and continual refinement in response to emerging insights.

Logicly responded by designing a tool that NAB’s managers could easily use to build and deliver tailored online surveys to their teams.

The data solution gathers, monitors, and comparatively assesses responses, which can then be downloaded in a clear and consistent format by the team leader.

### The outcomes
The NAB Survey Toolkit is a robust, flexible end-to-end tool that can adapt as the organisation’s needs change.

Its user-friendly design allows team leaders to gather valuable information efficiently in order to better engage with workers, and to focus their resources on achieving new goals.
