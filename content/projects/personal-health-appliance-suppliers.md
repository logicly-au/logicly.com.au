## We created a data management system to process and deliver health results in user-friendly reports.

### The information challenge
A personal health appliances supplier wanted to improve their customer’s experience and differentiate themselves from competitors.

A scalable data solution was needed that could allow members to easily sign-up, enter new information securely, and receive clear and accessible reports back.

Creating a user-friendly information system would increase their offering’s appeal, as well as form a useful marketing and communication tool.

### Our digital solution
Logicly worked with the supplier to understand their customers and the context of the challenge before designing the solution.

#### We developed a data processing application that could seamlessly:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Register new user accounts</li>
    <li>Record user data accurately</li>
    <li>Provide a secure login</li>
    <li>Deliver mobile-friendly reports</li>
  </ul>
</div>

The solution was considered from end-to-end to ensure a consistent and positive experience for members.

### The outcomes
The mobile-friendly design provides customers with a secure, easy-to-use portal for tracking and understanding their health outcomes.

It’s automated so that the supplier can maintain an accurate database for communication and marketing purposes, free of errors and duplicates.
