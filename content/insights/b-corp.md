The idea of 'doing work impactfully' has been informally embedded in Logicly since 1996 when Adam and Simon set up their operations on a mission to improve the way data was being collected, used and interpreted.

They were determined, and still are, to build a company to be proud of.


## What are B Corps?
B Corp Certification is a <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification">designation that a business is meeting high standards of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors including governance, customer service, employee benefits, stakeholder relationships and the environment.</a> 

Certification is a rigorous process - it took a lot of work from our small team to document and collate the evidence we needed to demonstrate that we met the requirements. 

## So why become a B Corp?
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
<li><strong>We can always do better.</strong><p>
<p>The B Impact Assessment helps measure, manage, and improve positive impact performance for the environment, communities, customers, suppliers and employees. It enables us to benchmark ourselves against similar organisations, identify our biggest gaps, and gives us a best practice framework for ongoing improvement.</p><p>
B Corps are required to undergo the verification process every three years in order to recertify. Working towards and maintaining our B Corp certification helps us to build a company we can continue to be proud of.</p></li>
<li><strong>We agree that business can be a force for good.</strong><p>
<p>We’re a privately owned business that believes that we can look after our customers and team, do our best for the planet, and support our communities.</p>
<p>We’re proud of the projects we work on and the clients we work with. Logicly’s genesis was the recognition that data can and should be collected, used and interpreted to drive better outcomes for people. Its very first project was supporting the new PTSD research facility at the Austin Repatriation Hospital, and three of our current major projects are dedicated to using data to improve mental health services across Australia. We also support research projects evaluating suicide prevention initiatives and help understand how public transport is used. We love working on projects with real public value.</p></li>
</ol>

## What it means for our customers

The B Corp accreditation is part of our commitment to an entirely new way of doing business for customers, employees, the community and the environment. This accreditation means that you can trust that we meet the highest standards for positive customer, social and environmental impact.
