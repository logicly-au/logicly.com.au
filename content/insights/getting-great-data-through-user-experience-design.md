# Do you make big decisions based on data?
Most government departments and large corporates do. Often there’s substantial money at stake. Sometimes it’s about allocating money to the people or projects that need it most. And often, the right decision is only evident when you have the full picture supported by detailed data and analysis.

## Data collection as a human process
Even if you’re automating your data collection, when you’re relying on people to supply the data, you need to make it as easy for them as possible. People are generally busy but if you focus on making the process easy for them, you’ll reap the rewards.

## What is user experience?
User experience is how easy and enjoyable a website, app or other system is to use. Good user experience design comes down to having a deep understanding of the user’s needs and abilities.

User experience can impact how willing people are to complete a task, as well as how complete and accurate the data they supply is.

A good user interface also needs to be accessible to users who interact with online content using assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## How we got better response rates and more accurate data for less money
Sounds too good to be true, but it’s not. Here’s what Mark Dorney from the Department of Transport and Main Roads had to say about the results of the <NuxtLink to="/projects/?article=1&tab=1">Queensland Online Travel Survey</NuxtLink>:

### Better response rates

![We move from paper to online](/We-move-from-paper-to-online.svg)

<div class=" text-center -mt-0 mb-4 sm:px-4 xl:px-10">
<span class="text-sm font-semibold text-logiclytheme2">Moving the data collection online increased the average response rate by 20% to 60% of all households approached</span>
</div>

<span class="m-2">"We still do face to face recruitment to get high response rates and not have to worry so much about respondent bias, but we no longer need to visit households to pick up the completed forms, or worse, leave a prepaid envelope with them and hope they send it in."</span> <br><span class="text-sm italic">- Mark Dorney, <a href="https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/">Department of Transport and Main Roads</a> </span>

### Big improvements in data quality
<span class="m-2">"The self-completion online entry saves us a small amount in data entry costs, but the big win is in data quality. The form uses the Google API for addresses and allows filling in forms in a very similar manner to using Google Maps, which many people are familiar with. We're not spending our time trying to second guess what someone scrawled on their form."</span> <br><span class="text-sm italic">- Mark Dorney, <a href="https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/">Department of Transport and Main Roads</a> </span></span>

### Cost savings
<span class="m-2">"Of course, the big way we save money is by TMR owning the data entry and survey administration tools, so lowering the barriers to entry for prospective fieldwork operators when we go out to market."</span> <br><span class="text-sm italic">- Mark Dorney, <a href="https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/">Department of Transport and Main Roads</a> </span></span>

## How we do it
We partner with clients flexibly and collaboratively to simplify the complex. We’ve got a <NuxtLink to="/howwework/">solid process</NuxtLink> that we’ve refined over many years in business. More than anything else, our continuous cycle of learning, defining and refining is what gets results.

With the Queensland Travel Diary project, we worked closely with the client and usability team. We learned how people would interact with the system – sometimes on the go, sometimes after the fact – and designed a system that was flexible and responsive. We undertook a fortnight of user testing where we implemented iterative changes every day to keep refining and improving the system.

## The result?
Yes, we improved completion rates, the data was more accurate and we saved money. But the real win was the department having more confidence when planning future transport infrastructure. The use of public funds will be optimised and the community’s transport needs will be better met well into the future.
