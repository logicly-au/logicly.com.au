# How do you prove the value of your department’s service?
Putting together a business case to secure budget? Reporting back for public accountability? Fulfilling an information request from a Minister? You’ll need good data. Data that’s accurate, compelling and often available at the drop of a hat. How can you make sure that the right data is there when you need it? The answer lies in having thoughtfully designed digital systems. Your systems need to solve your complex information challenges and easily adapt to your changing needs.

## That sounds tricky. Where to start?
Choosing <NuxtLink to="/about/ourapproach">a collaborative partner</NuxtLink> to support your data requirements is key. Look for a <NuxtLink to="/about/ourteam">diverse team</NuxtLink> with a range of backgrounds, experiences and skills.

![Co-designing for data success in the public sector](/co-designing-for-data-success-in-the-public-sector.png)

At Logicly, our <NuxtLink to="/projects/?article=0&tab=0">most successful projects</NuxtLink> happen when there’s deep collaboration between your experts, our experts, and your key stakeholders. We become an extension of your team so we can deeply understand your needs and deliver solutions that do more than you ever imagined. We want to engage with your stakeholders in a meaningful way to design solutions that are fit for purpose. To achieve this, we use a <NuxtLink to="/howwework">process called co-design</NuxtLink>.

## What is co-design?
<a href="https://www.ncoss.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Codesign-principles.pdf">Co-design</a> is the process of involving internal and external experts, stakeholders and citizens in the creation of services, products and solutions. The theory is that mixing professional expertise and lived experience creates dramatically better outcomes.

It’s being increasingly used by <a href="https://www.vic.gov.au/co-design">governments</a> to explore problems and solutions collaboratively. It helps the public sector create solutions that best serve community needs within government constraints.

## Why co-design?
In our experience, co-designing digital systems has a powerful impact. It truly helps design the best system possible. Because we get to deeply understand the sometimes competing needs of everyone involved, we can co-create new solutions that meet the data needs of the organisation while being as engaging and usable as possible for the stakeholders. And because the stakeholders feel heard and valued, there can be better buy-in which leads to better data outcomes.

## What are the principles of co-design?
Focus the entire process of co-design on the outcomes you seek. Whether you’re looking to create a new system or improve an existing one, you need to be clear on your objectives throughout.

The way that you engage and communicate is critical too. You must be inclusive and respectful, and encourage participation from all stakeholder groups, not just the loud ones.

It’s important to get input into the design and then get feedback on prototypes. And co-design doesn’t stop at system launch. You can keep going back to users to get feedback and make design improvements.

We strive to understand the reasons behind the data collection need and the pain points for all stakeholders. By creating solutions that make life easier for everyone involved, we ensure stakeholders are true advocates who are more willing to provide data promptly. This also leads to more accurate data and better outcomes.

## A co-design success story

<NuxtLink to="/projects/?article=3&tab=1"><span class="font-bold">The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC MDS)</span></NuxtLink>


### The project
We worked with the Department of Health and the Primary Health Networks (PHN) to consolidate various health service datasets into a secure, accessible, national system.

### The need
To track the quality of current mental healthcare services offered by their providers to improve planning and direct future funding.

### The players
The co-design process gave unprecedented insight into the needs and constraints of the Department, the PHN, the services and the community.

### The outcomes
Our time-saving automated solutions reduced input workload and enabled instant, customised, succinct data outputs to meet the varied needs of stakeholders. We accommodated differing laws and statutory requirements across states and territories to develop a consolidated national solution.

<span class="m-2">‘You guys are an absolute pleasure to work with, the PMHC MDS is a fabulous system because of your expertise, and we really appreciate your flexibility and responsiveness.’</span> <br><span class="text-sm italic">– Director, <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/">Australian Government Department of Health</a></span>

### An ever-evolving system
Since the launch of this project, we’ve continued to co-design successful improvements and extensions.

<span class="m-2">‘We needed to start collecting information about The WayBack program quickly and with as little additional burden on the data providers as possible. The use of an extension onto the PMHC MDS meant that the data providers would use their already existing processes making implementation an easier process. The Logicly Support Service has been invaluable to assist our staff, the data providers and even third-party developers to navigate the data set. Logicly helped us shepherd the project to achieve tight deadlines, talking through complex data challenges using plain language which enabled quick decision making. They also helped us design and implement the reports so that we can get the information we need for our own reporting processes in the format we need quickly.’</span> <br><span class="text-sm italic">- Jennifer Smith, Project Manager, The Way Back Support Service Strategy & Infrastructure, <a href="https://www.beyondblue.org.au/">Beyond Blue</a></span>

## Are you ready to co-design your next data system?
We’d love to help. And because <NuxtLink to="/whowehelp">we’ve worked with Government</NuxtLink> for decades, we know our way around your procurement, compliance and security systems which will make things easy for you. <NuxtLink to="/contactus">So, let’s chat about your project.</NuxtLink>
