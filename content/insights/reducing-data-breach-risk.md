# Information security methods for the public sector
Information security, or data security, is a hot topic. With recent cyberattacks on Optus, Medibank and Woolworths, everyone is paying more attention to how organisations protect their data and information.

The public sector is not immune, as evidenced by the Australian Defence Force cyberattack, which compromised top-secret defence data. For government bodies, information security is a matter of compliance, trust and reputation. You’re dealing with sensitive and confidential data affecting millions of Australians’ lives and wellbeing. Their data must be safe from unauthorised access, modification or deletion.

Information security is complex, but you need to address and conquer it. Misconceptions around information security can make it confusing and difficult to manage your risk effectively. This article will debunk some common myths and give tips on implementing information security thoughtfully and sustainably. We’ll also explain how our team can help solve your complex information security challenges so you can accurately understand your risks and make considered decisions about appropriate responses.

## What is information security?
<strong>Information security is the process of safeguarding digital information from unauthorised or unintended access, modification or loss. It covers various aspects of information protection and applies technical, organisational and legal measures to prevent, detect and respond to potential threats and incidents that can compromise information systems and the data they hold.</strong>

It’s a complex field, and misconceptions abound. Let’s take a look at some of the myths surrounding information security and data security to set the record straight.

## Myth 1: More security is always better.
One of the biggest mistakes organisations make is to think they should try to address every single security risk and apply the highest level of security possible for their data. Following this myth can waste resources and reduce efficiency. You need to assess the risks associated with the data you hold and apply the appropriate level of security that matches your needs, context and resources.

### More security does not always mean better security.
Applying excessive or unnecessary security measures can have negative consequences for your organisation, such as:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>Diverting scarce resources: given that resources, including time and expertise, are limited, risks and their mitigations should be prioritised such that those with the highest impact are addressed first.</li>
  <li>Increasing your costs and complexity: the more technologies, tools and methods that you need to acquire, implement and maintain can increase your expenses, overheads, and technical and operational challenges.</li>
  <li>Reducing your performance and usability: more security means more restrictions and controls that you need to comply with and enforce. This can reduce your speed and flexibility, as well as your user experience and satisfaction, potentially leading users to circumvent safe practices to achieve their objectives.</li>
  <li>Creating new risks and vulnerabilities: having more complex security than you need increases the changes and updates that you need to monitor and manage. This can create new errors and gaps, as well as new threats and attacks. </li>
</ul>
</div>

### How can you determine an information security approach that’s just right?
We follow a risk-based approach to information security that balances the likelihood and impact of potential incidents. By prioritising your data security needs according to their importance and urgency, you can allocate your resources wisely.

The <a href="https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/publications-library/policy-8-classification-system">Australian Government</a> advises organisations to allocate a security classification based on the lowest reasonable security level. This ensures that limited resources are deployed where they are most effective. Each increase in the classification level necessitates additional effort to reach and maintain compliance that might not be necessary and diverts limited resources from other areas of importance.


## Myth 2: Information security is a box-ticking exercise.
Another misconception is to think that information security is a one-off task that can be ticked off and then forgotten. This is a dangerous mindset that can expose you to serious risks and vulnerabilities. Information security is not a static state, but a dynamic process that requires constant attention and improvement.

### The data landscape is constantly changing.
Every day, the goalposts shift. There are new:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>threats, attacks and vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>technologies, tools and platforms</li>
  <li>data sources, formats and types</li>
</ul>
</div>

To keep up with these changes, you must regularly monitor, review and update your information security approach. You need to keep on top of assessing your current situation, identifying your gaps and weaknesses, implementing your changes and measuring your results.

### How to adopt a proactive and holistic approach.
Ensure your information security approach covers all aspects of your systems design, implementation and configuration, personnel training and knowledge, and the data lifecycle from collection, storage, processing, analysis, sharing and disposal. Here are five ideas to get you started:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
  <li>Consider the technical, human, organisational and legal aspects of information security.</li>
  <li>Involve all your stakeholders, including staff, partners, suppliers, customers and regulators.</li>
  <li>Establish clear policies, procedures and standards for information security that align with your legal obligations, goals and values.</li>
  <li>Educate and train your staff on data security best practices and responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Audit and test your data security system regularly and fix any issues promptly.</li>
</ol>
</div>

## Myth 3: Information security is the same for every project.
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions for information security or silver bullets that can address every issue. This assumption can lead to ineffective and inefficient outcomes. Information security can’t be generic, it must be specific depending on the context and characteristics of each project.

### Every project has different information security requirements and challenges.
All projects are unique, with diverse:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>type, volume, sensitivity and value of held data</li>
  <li>purpose, scope, duration and complexity of the project</li>
  <li>stakeholders, expectations, regulations and standards</li>
</ul>
</div>

To address these variations, you must tailor your information security system to fit your needs and context.

### How to design a tailored information security system.
You need to thoroughly analyse your project before you design and implement your information security approach.
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
  <li>Define your objectives, scope, deliverables and success criteria.</li>
  <li>Identify your data sources, types, formats and volumes.</li>
  <li>Assess the sensitivity, confidentiality and integrity of your data.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the risks, threats and vulnerabilities of your data.</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate technologies, tools and methods to support your data security approach.</li>
</ol>
</div>

## Myth 4: Information security systems eliminate data risk.
Some organisations expect an information security approach will provide them with absolute certainty and assurance that their data is safe from harm or loss. This is unrealistic and can lead to overconfidence and complacency. Information security is not a binary state but a relative one that depends on the level of protection and resilience you can achieve. Rather than thinking, ‘Is my system secure?’, start framing the question as ‘Is my system being managed securely?’

### Why there are no guarantees in information security.
There’s always a possibility that someone or something can breach or compromise your information security, no matter how advanced or sophisticated it is. There are always trade-offs between security and other factors such as cost, performance, usability and convenience. Uncertainties and unknowns in the data environment are unavoidable.

### How to manage information security risk.
You need to accept that information security is not a guarantee but a goal you can strive for. By adopting a risk-based approach to information security, you can balance the likelihood and impact of potential incidents.
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
  <li>Implement multiple layers of defence and backup for your information security system to prevent, detect and respond to different types of attacks.</li>
  <li>Have a contingency plan and a recovery plan for your information security system that can minimise the damage and restore normal operations in case of a breach or failure.</li>
  <li>Constantly maintain and improve your security system in response to the changing environment.</li>
</ol>
</div>

## Myth 5: Information security can be added at any time
We often see organisations treat information security as an afterthought, a bolt-on feature that can be added or removed as needed. This costly and risky practice can compromise the quality and effectiveness of your information security system. So, while you can add it at any time, it’s much more efficient to integrate data security from the beginning than to retrofit later.

### Information security is not a standalone function.
Information security is an integrated activity that affects and is affected by all aspects of your project, so it’s more effective to consider it upfront.

### How to incorporate information security into every stage of your project lifecycle.
It’s best to involve information security experts from the beginning of your project and throughout its duration. You should apply information security principles and practices in every activity and decision of your project, monitoring and measuring the performance and effectiveness of your information security system at every milestone and deliverable of your project.

## How to decide on an appropriate information security system
Now that you know some common myths and tips around information security, you might wonder how to decide on an appropriate information security system for your project. This question has no definitive answer, as it depends on your timeline, resources, expectations and project parameters. Here are a few pointers to get you started:

### Legislative requirements
The first step is understanding the legislative requirements for your project. Australian entities are subject to various laws and regulations that govern how you collect, store, process, share and dispose of data.

### Type of data and impact of breaches
There are serious implications to data breaches including fines, reputation and business continuity. You must consider the type of data you deal with and the effects of a potential breach on your organisation. Different types of data have different levels of sensitivity and value, such as personal information, health information, financial information or national security information. The impact of a breach can vary from minor inconvenience to major disaster. Classify your data according to its sensitivity and value and assess the impact of a breach using a risk matrix.

### Consider the business case
Think about the trade-off between investing in information security versus recovering from a worst-case scenario, because it can save you money and time in the long run. According to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">report by IBM</a>, the average cost of a data breach in 2023 was US$4.45M.

### Explore your options
If there are budget or timing constraints, you have options. Information security can be expensive and time-consuming, depending on the level of protection and resilience you need. However, this does not mean that you must compromise on information security or settle for a suboptimal solution. There are options that can help you achieve your information security goals within your budget and timeline.

Start by prioritising your information security needs according to their importance and urgency and allocate your resources wisely according to their value and impact. You should explore alternative solutions that offer similar or better outcomes at lower costs or faster speeds. Negotiating with your stakeholders on their expectations and requirements may also help.
