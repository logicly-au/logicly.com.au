If you’re responsible for exploring opportunities to leverage the power of AI in your job, the possibilities are exciting but come with uncertainties. How can you tap into AI’s potential without taking on too much risk? How can you ensure your AI projects align with your goals without compromising data security or ethics?

This article explores practical, <a href="https://www.logicly.com.au/insights/incremental-success">incremental steps</a> towards responsible AI adoption. Learn how to start navigating this new landscape and achieve real results while feeling confident you won’t expose your organisation to undue risk.</a> 

## The opportunity: leveraging AI for impactful innovation
AI offers immense opportunities for organisations looking to innovate and improve their services. The government <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-mark-butler-mp/media/unlocking-the-power-of-ai-to-transform-healthcare">recently announced</a> it’s investing almost $30 million in research into new ways to use AI to improve access to health services and ensure that our health system remains world-class.

Here are just a few examples of other projects exploring creative AI solutions that enhance service delivery and outcomes:

<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10444735/">Foresight Medical</a> explored the use of AI to detect eye biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/Articles/2019/October/ai-for-environmental-and-social-good"> CSIRO’s Energy Business Unit</a> uses AI to optimise Australia’s energy network via a digital simulation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/new-sydney-roads-and-more-regional-councils-join-asset-ai-0">Asset AI®</a> is revolutionising road asset maintenance and operations in NSW.</li>
</ul>
</div>

The safest way to capitalise on opportunities is to start with small, focused AI projects that don’t overextend available resources. Whether improving operational efficiency or developing new services, the potential for AI-driven innovation is vast—but it requires a careful, deliberate approach to avoid common pitfalls.

## The risks: navigating AI’s ethical and practical challenges
While AI’s potential is undeniable, so too are the risks. Biases in AI systems, data privacy issues and AI ‘hallucinations’—where AI generates incorrect or misleading information—pose significant challenges. 

The <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/governance-and-user-education/artificial-intelligence/engaging-with-artificial-intelligence"> Australian Cyber Security Centre</a> has highlighted the importance of using AI securely, warning that AI systems can inadvertently identify individuals by correlating non-personal data with other datasets, leading to re-identification. This is an increasingly pressing concern as AI technology evolves and the lines between personal and non-personal data blur.

Moreover, the cost of AI implementation is a considerable barrier. AI projects often require substantial computational power, leading to high expenses that can strain budgets. There are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/05/chatgpt-hidden-cost-gpu-compute/"> hidden costs</a> to AI. As of 2024, the costs associated with AI are significantly underwritten by investors therefore it is difficult to estimate the likely cost of a long-running project. Test cases make sense. Realistic estimation of the ongoing costs should remain a significant consideration for any organisation looking to adopt this technology for any project of significant duration.

## The strategy: start small, think big
Given the complexities and costs associated with AI, a cautious, <a href="https://www.logicly.com.au/insights/incremental-success">incremental approach</a> is essential. Rather than diving headfirst into large-scale AI projects, organisations should focus on small, manageable initiatives that align with their strategic goals. This allows them to test the waters, gather valuable feedback and refine their AI applications before scaling up.

## Responsible AI: balancing innovation with ethics
As AI technology advances, responsible AI practices are more important than ever. Organisations must ensure their AI systems are ethical, transparent and aligned with broader societal values. 

The Australian Government has taken a significant step in this direction by introducing the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/blogs/responsible-choices-new-policy-using-ai-australian-government">Policy for the Responsible Use of AI in Government</a>, effective 1 September 2024. This policy positions the government as a leader in safe and responsible AI use, focusing on enhancing public trust through transparency, governance and risk assurance.

The policy’s ‘enable, engage, and evolve’ framework guides agencies in adopting AI while balancing innovation with protecting public interests. For example, agencies must establish clear accountability for AI adoption and publish transparency statements within six months. This approach reflects the growing need for AI systems that are both effective and explainable to the public.

The <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/Articles/2023/November/Responsible-AI-explainer">CSIRO’s explainer on Responsible AI</a> also offers valuable guidance on achieving balance, emphasising the need for effective and trustworthy AI systems.

By incorporating responsible AI practices from the outset, you can build trust with stakeholders and the public and ensure that their AI initiatives are sustainable in the long term.
