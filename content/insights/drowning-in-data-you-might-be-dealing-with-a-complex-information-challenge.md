# Why is data so important?
No matter what your industry, it’s likely that data plays a role. Data can help you:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>make better decisions</li>
  <li>establish baselines and set goals</li>
  <li>monitor service effectiveness</li>
  <li>understand your clients</li>
  <li>predict the future</li>
</ul>
</div>

When you’re responsible for the collection and analysis of data for your organisation, there’s plenty to consider. Especially when your project moves beyond a simple data collection exercise to a complex data challenge.

If you’re feeling a little overwhelmed by the data challenge you’re facing, it might help to take a step back and look at the factors that are contributing to the complexity.

## What makes a data challenge complex?
There are many factors that contribute to data complexity. In this article, we’ll focus on our top four, using an example project to bring it all to life.

<div class="bg-logiclylightgrey pl-6 sm:pl-12 pr-6 sm:pr-16 pt-4 sm:pt-8 pb-6 my-4">

### PROJECT SPOTLIGHT:
<div class="font-semibold text-sm pr-12">A thrice-yearly census for over 70,000 pre-school children and teachers</div>

<span class="text-sm">The Department of Education and Training needed a sophisticated and accessible data management system to securely collect and store the personal details and routines of around 72,000 children and their teachers. Our solution was quickly implemented across the state, and insights gathered continue to inform decisions for early-learning strategy and policy.</span>

### 1. Flat vs relational data
Without getting too technical, the biggest factor that determines if you have a simple or complex data challenge is whether your data is flat or relational.
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>Flat data is based around a single table. </li>
  <li>Relational data is based around multiple tables that cross-reference to each other.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Using our project example, the key data need was recording the number of children attending each early-learning class in each centre in the state. If we were just collecting the de-identified demographic data of the children, a single table would have sufficed. However, we needed the ability to ensure there were no duplicates and to cross reference the de-identified data of the children and educators to link the records with their correct classes. This requirement for cross-referencing automatically made the challenge a more complex one, and we needed to design a platform that specifically addressed those needs.

### 2. The number of submitters and their varying contexts

The success of most data projects relies heavily on people submitting accurate data, and people cannot always be relied on to do so. In many settings, there can be inadequate IT skills, insufficient IT infrastructure and scarce human resources. In the project example, we created an intuitive interface and offered a helpdesk to support them but without doubt, managing people can be a large contributor to the complexity of any project.

### 3. Sheer volume of data

The sheer volume of data can be a challenge in itself. In our example project, we collect the data of around 72,000 children from approximately 1,980 early childhood education centres across Victoria. This results in over 350,000 data points, three times per year. That’s a lot of data to be stored, but more importantly, any platform must be designed to extract useful data sets that provide relevant information to decision makers.

### 4. Data security

Security is one of the most critical factors in any data management system. In our example, we needed to collect highly sensitive data about every Victorian pre-school child. For the purposes of reporting, the data needed to be de-identified so that trends across centres, local government areas and the entire state could be analysed without divulging any personal data. When you’re dealing with sensitive data, you need to have extremely robust systems that allow multiple layers of access and security, because breaches can be catastrophic for organisations and individuals alike.

## Where to now?

So, if you’ve established that your data challenge is a complex one, what should you do next?

You can investigate the many “software as a service” platforms to see if they suit your project needs. You can buy a licence and customise your own solution and if you have the appropriate in-house skills, this can be a very effective option. We’ll let you know during early conversations if we think an off-the-shelf solution might work for you.

## When to get help.
Sometimes you’ll need to engage an expert to get a successful outcome. If any of these points resonate, it’s probably time to raise your hand:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>You need onshore hosting: most “software as a service” platforms host offshore, so if this is a requirement for you, you’ll need to engage with a local supplier</li>
  <li>You need strategic advice: if you’re still a bit unsure what the solution is or how to tackle the project, you might need to access some expert advice</li>
  <li>You need tailored functionality: if there’s anything tricky about your data, off-the-shelf solutions may not be the answer</li>
  <li>You want an independent custodian: if you don’t want the responsibility of managing sensitive data, or if the task requires an independent 3rd party, then you’ll need to find a trusted partner</li>
  <li>You need sophisticated security: off the shelf solutions have substantial security built in, but if your data is highly sensitive or requires differing levels of security applied to different users, it’s safer to create your own platform.</li>
</ul>

## More example projects.
Reading through some more of our past work might give you some ideas on how to tackle your own project. Here a few more examples of our work with corporate and government clients, and there’s plenty more on <NuxtLink to="/projects">our website</NuxtLink>.


### Secure data management for complex stakeholder environments
We partnered with the Department of Health and over 30 entities in the primary health regional network to consolidate different health service datasets in a new, secure, more accessible information system. We navigated the state’s differing laws and statutory requirements to develop an intuitive, feature-rich, national platform in just 6 months.<br>

### Sophisticated algorithms to protect vulnerable participants
When we worked with the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Mental Health, we developed an automated alert function to notify study psychologists where specialised and urgent care interventions may be needed to keep participants safe. Our sophisticated algorithms recommended appropriate treatment and longitudinal data collection tracked changes over time.<br>

### Goodbye forms and spreadsheets, hello web platform
We worked with the National Australia Bank to build a system that creates and delivers personalised performance management surveys to its 40,000+ strong workforce. Our solution analyses the high volumes of data efficiently and communicates the results in accessible reports. It’s a robust, flexible end-to-end tool that will adapt as the organisation’s needs change.<br>
