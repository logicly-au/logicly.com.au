# Why is accurate data collection important?
If you’re responsible for decision making in your organisation, chances are you’re relying on data to guide you. Accurate data can help you make informed choices, leading to improved efficiency, profitability, customer satisfaction, employee retention and growth.

If the data that you’re relying on isn’t accurate, then you might make some costly decisions. So, what sorts of things should you be looking out for?

## Counting things can be tricky
For data to be accurate, it just needs to be correct. Simple, right? Actually, not always.

Normally you want to know something about groups of people, and so you sort them into categories: age, gender, income, height, sales they achieve, widgets they bought, places they live, services they require... And a single person might belong in two categories. Or their condition might change over time.

We manage a lot of data for our clients. They’ll often need to know things like:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>How many patients have we treated?</li>
  <li>How far do our staff live from our office?</li>
  <li>How satisfied are our customers?</li>
</ul>
</div>

On the face of it, answering these questions seems like a straightforward task. But often, there’s not a simple 1-1 relationship between your population of interest and the thing you need to know about them.

For instance, let’s say we have 5 health services under our control, and we are tracking how many people visit each service each day. If we have 20 patients per day, that must mean we treat 100 people every day over our group, right? Sorry, not that simple. One person may have visited several services, therefore our initial assumption of 100 individual patients would be overstated.

Similar problems could be encountered in our other examples. In checking how far our staff live from our office, what if they have more than one home? What if they are about to move house? What if they still receive mail at their parent’s house, but actually reside at their partner’s home? How do we count staff who are part time or work in multiple locations? How does that affect the policy decisions we are aiming to make?

And in our customer satisfaction example, how do we count our success rate if some customers are both satisfied and unsatisfied? What implications does that have when we are weighing up alternatives to improve customer satisfaction when our resources are limited?

## How we ensure data is accurate
There is a whole discipline to make sure your data collection methodology produces clean, accurate data.

You need to ensure the incoming data is checked rigorously, by having strict controls on formatting, consistency, duplicates and completeness. Having a data quality process to continuously ensure that the controls are working is also critical.

But most importantly, you need to be comfortable that what you are counting makes sense and will give you accurate information to help guide your decision making. As we’ve pointed out, it’s easy to make assumptions when you’re counting things that simplifies the situation and leads to inaccurate data. Decisions made on inaccurate data can be costly – it’s important to get this right.

We lean on our extensive experience to ensure the data we collect will meet your information needs. We take the time to understand your business and your current systems, and we conduct extensive scenario testing to ensure any data issues and unique complications are highlighted before the system is designed. By deeply understanding what you need to use the data for, we can ask all the right questions so that we can accurately slice and dice the data in the ways you need.

If you’re now wondering whether you’re making critical decisions based on inaccurate data, we’re happy to help. <NuxtLink to="/contactus">Get in touch today</NuxtLink> for a free discovery call.
