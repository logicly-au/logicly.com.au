Rebuilding software from scratch is no easy task. Take the federal government’s failed enterprise resource planning project as an example. Over $341 million was spent before the project was <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/2-2b-lost-in-federal-it-fails-after-fifth-project-abandoned-20240819-p5k3ko">abandoned</a> after it did not deliver as originally intended. 

Developing a completely new solution in a complex environment - full of incompatible legacy systems and unclear responsibilities - was bound to be challenging. An <a href="https://www.logicly.com.au/insights/incremental-success/">iterative approach</a> could well have avoided this disastrous outcome. It’s a good example of why replacing systems isn’t always the best solution.

It’s a familiar story. Technology moves so fast that it doesn’t take long for an existing application or piece of software to feel out of date. It can be hard to decide whether building from scratch will be easier than evolving what already exists. While starting fresh may seem tempting, renovating what you already have is often a better choice.

But when is it best to evolve? And what are the risks of replacing? Let’s explore these questions through real-world examples and actionable insights.

## The key benefits of software evolution
Evolution is usually the smarter choice when deciding how to move forward with your software. Here are the top reasons why.

### 1. Preserving past investments

Existing software often reflects years of work and embedded knowledge for users. Starting from scratch risks erasing that value while evolving builds on a solid foundation. For systems that are mostly fit for purpose but need updates, a targeted renovation can often deliver transformative results without the disruption of a full rebuild. The independent investigation into the government’s <a href="https://www.logicly.com.au/insights/incremental-success/">failed business registers project</a> recommended this approach and advised rolling back to the old system and focusing on smaller-scale updates.

### 2. Maximising cost-effectiveness
Evolving an existing product leverages previous investment, avoids duplication of effort and minimises waste. Adding new features or modules to address emerging needs is typically faster and more cost-effective than rebuilding from the ground up, particularly when the core functionality remains sound.

### 3. Building user trust and ensuring continuity
A full replacement can disrupt your users, especially if it removes features they rely on or the service is interrupted. Evolving your software allows you to keep everything running while making improvements, which helps you maintain trust and deliver changes in a way that feels seamless and avoids unnecessary upheaval.

#### Case study: The Mental Health Establishments National Minimum Data Set (MHE NMDS) 

The WA Mental Health Commission (MHC) relies on software to collect and validate mental health data sets from organisations across the state. Before 2014, this happened using spreadsheets—a process prone to error and delays. That year, we built an online data tool to modernise data collection, streamlining workflows and reducing reporting time by 75%.

By 2023, new requirements arose. There were stricter security standards including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and integration with internal systems. Initially, MHC considered replacing the system, but we proposed a different path: evolving the existing tool through iterative redevelopment.

Here’s how our approach delivered all the benefits of software evolution:

<strong>Preserved embedded knowledge:</strong> Over nearly a decade, the tool was maintained, refined and optimised, embedding valuable insights into its functionality. Evolving instead of replacing it retained these hard-earned improvements.

<strong>Seamless updates:</strong> Rather than building a new system while maintaining the old one, we iteratively upgraded the existing tool. For example, MFA was added first to meet immediate needs without delaying other improvements.

<strong>Cost-efficient transformation:</strong> The iterative approach minimised disruption and prioritised changes that would carry forward into future upgrades, saving time and money.

This strategy delivered immediate results while ensuring the system stayed adaptable for future needs. 

### When replacement becomes necessary
While evolving software is often the best approach, there are times when replacement is unavoidable. These scenarios typically involve situations where evolution is no longer practical or cost-effective:

<strong>Unresolvable technical debt:</strong> Outdated or unsupported platforms, inaccessible source code, or legacy components can make evolution impossible.

<strong>Seamless updates:</strong> Rather than building a new system while maintaining the old one, we iteratively upgraded the existing tool. For example, MFA was added first to meet immediate needs without delaying other improvements.

<strong>Dramatic shifts in requirements:</strong> Significant regulatory or business requirements changes can render existing systems obsolete.

#### Case study: Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS)

### Case study: The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads Online Travel Survey

In our ATAPS project, changing government requirements completely transformed the data and regulatory standards needed to be met. The shift was so significant that we recommended a full rebuild. However, even in this scenario, we planned for continuity—maintaining the old system while developing the new one to avoid gaps in service.

Our advice? If replacement is the only option, always plan for overlap. Relying on the new system being completely ready and perfectly functional on time is risky and can leave organisations without a safety net.

## Key considerations in software evolution versus software replacement

Choosing between evolution and replacement is both a technical and strategic decision. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help your decision:

<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
  <li>What value does the existing system still offer? Is it still meeting core needs?</li>
  <li>Can critical functionality be retained through evolution?</li>
  <li>What are the risks of disrupting current operations and starting fresh?</li>
  <li>Have you accounted for potential delays or hidden complexities in a rebuild?</li>
  <li>There is tacit knowledge embedded in the current system. Can it be retained by evolving?</li>
  <li>Will replacing the system lose critical insights or processes?</li>
  <li>What are the long-term costs?</li>
  <li>Is evolving more cost-effective than building from scratch?</li>
  <li>Are there budget or timeline constraints that favour one approach?</li>
</ol>
</div>

Our approach starts with reviewing these questions and more, helping clients weigh the risks and benefits of each path before developing a considered plan to move forward.

## Evolving for long-term success

Thinking you need to start from scratch when your software no longer meets your needs is a common misconception. More often than not, evolving your existing system offers a more stable, efficient and cost-effective solution. By prioritising maintenance and iterative improvements, you can preserve past investments, address immediate priorities and keep your systems adaptable for the future.
