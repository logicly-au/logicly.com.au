              Adam has worked in information technology, data management, and software delivery since 1991 while a Psychology student at Melbourne University. For 10 years prior to that it was his hobby. Adam has a diverse set of skills including research methods, programming, database design, internet technologies, and data analysis. He is a national leader in the design, implementation and support of IT systems for minimum data sets. Adam co-founded Logicly (then Strategic Data) in 1996 and is also our CTO and technical lead, managing all the work to keep systems relevant, running, and consistent with their security requirements.

              When away from work Adam can often be found attending local gigs and music festivals. He has also recently rekindled a childhood obsession with planted aquaria, largely in lieu of the former, thanks to COVID-19.

              Prior to co-founding Logicly (then Strategic Data), Simon's professional career shifted from social research and program evaluation to issues of computer-interface design, usability and information presentation. For 15 years he was a registered psychologist, bringing a counseling-influenced approach to the collection, management, analysis and presentation of data. Simon’s particular expertise is in identifying the information required to support an objective, and specifying technical infrastructure to enable the collection and application of relevant data.

              In his normal life Simon likes playing the guitar, riding his bike, and discussing off-beat topics over fine dinners.

              Eleven years ago Michelle started as an account manager for WebSurvey. Since then she has added WebSurvey Manager and Project Manager to her list of titles, got her hands dirty ensuring that company policies and protocols were in place (and consistent), and helped Andrew keep an eye on the finance side of things. In 2018 her company wide involvement saw her take on a tailor made role as Manager of Business Operations, and in 2021 she added ‘Director’ to the tally. Michelle gets excited by strategy, operations and a quality approach to project delivery.

              On the weekends Michelle can be found (or not) hiking in the bush, visiting art galleries, or drinking coffee.
